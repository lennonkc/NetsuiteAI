This will help us get them onboarded faster and reduce downtime on their first day.\n\nFor example, if a user needs access to Monday.com, you can comment on this ticket and we will assign the app before the new user starts.\n\nIf there is another Thrasher who should provide this information to us, please let us know the person's name and we will add them to this ticket as the requester. If you would prefer to have the new employee request access to applications themselves on their first day, please reply to let us know and we will close this ticket.\n\nPlease note, all users will automatically receive the following applications, so you do not need to specify them:\nGmail / Google Workspace\nSlack\nZoom\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming your new hire!\n\nThank you,\nThrasio IT Team",

The product is 2pack, even with the freight fee and duties, **this COGS is at most $4.55, not $9.00**, which is already higher than the COGS of 3pack, which is very unreasonable.\n\nI noticed that some ASINs status for Green Bulldog in the POS report are incorrect, while it’s accurate on the Thrasio Tool. I’m not sure if the sales data error is related to this.\n\nCould someone please look into this? Thanks!",
